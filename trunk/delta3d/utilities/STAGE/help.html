<u><h2>Info</h2></u>
STAGE (Simulation, Training And Game Editor) is an editing tool used to create and modify maps used in the Delta3D Engine.<br>

<u><h2>Setup</h2></u>
<h3>Context</h3>
When running STAGE for the first time, you will first need to set up the context directory.  The contex directory is where the editor will find all its assets such as maps, meshes, and textures.  To set the context directory go to "File->Change Project..." in the file menu and choose an appropriate folder.<br>
<h3>Maps</h3>
Creating a new map is as easy as "File->New Map...".  You can always load maps from "File->Open Map...".<br>
Actors: Actors make up the world, all objects in the map that require a position are actors.  These can represent anything from meshes to particle effects to even sounds that are locational.<br>

<u><h2>Layout</h2></u>
<h3>Actors Tab</h3>
The actors tab contains a list of actor classes that can be created and used throughout your maps.<br>
<h3>Prefabs Tab</h3>
A prefab is a resource that contains a group of pre-defined actors that can be placed as if they are a single actor.<br>
<h3>Actor Search</h3>
This is a search window that allows you to view all actors in your map.<br>
<h3>Global Actors</h3>
This is a list that displays all Global Actors in your map.  Global actors are actors that don't need a position because they are globally active.<br>
<h3>Resources</h3>
The Resources window contains resources found in the context directory.  Resources are broken down into types including Static meshes, Skeletal meshes, Sounds, Particles, Textures, and Terrains.<br>
<h3>Editor Viewports</h3>
The Editor Viewports are the windows located in the center of the editor, they represent the various views (2D, 3D) of the currently open map and allow you to edit it.<br>
<h3>Property Editor</h3>
This window displays all the properties of the currently selected actors.  From here to can view and edit individual properties of an actor.<br>

<u><h2>Plugins</h2></u>
Plugins can be used to increase the functionality of STAGE by providing custom tools.  To enable a plugin, go to "Edit->Manager Plugins..." in the file menu.<br>
Depending on the plugins that are active, new menu's, toolbar buttons, and windows will be created for the user.<br>
