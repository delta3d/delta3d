    * This class is the base task actor in the Delta3D task system.  This
    * class should be extended by any classes wishing to provide specialized
    * task behavior.  Each task has general properties such as score, passing
    * score, etc.  In addition, all tasks have a parent child relationship thus
    * facilitating the concept of nested tasks and task dependencies.
    *
    * All Task Actors are in one of 3 states:  IsComplete(), IsFailed(), or neither.
    * Generally, a Task can change it's score and other values until it becomes Complete or
    * Failed. At that point, it is no longer mutable and shouldn't change much.
    * The complete state is typically determined automatically - when a minimal
    * score is reached like when all child tasks are complete. The Failed stage
    * is typically set manually when you want to force a task to be failed. Sometimes a
    * task will be marked Failed automatically based on parent or container task
    * behaviors (such as a Ordered Failing task done out of order).
