    * The NodePluginRegistry is the base class that developers extend to
    * build their own Node registries.  Its main purpose is to serve as an
    * object factory which knows how to build Nodes using
    * NodeTypes as the tool by which to do so.
    *
    * @note
    *      Registry objects should only be used with the dtCore::RefPtr<>
    *      construct since they are reference counted objects.
    * @see NodeType
    * @see Node
    * @note The dynamic library file containing the Node Registry must contain
    *  two exported "C" methods, to create and destroy the NodePluginRegistry.
    *
    * Example:
    * @code
    * extern "C" DT_EXAMPLE_EXPORT dtDirector::NodePluginRegistry* CreatePluginRegistry()
    * {
    *    return new TestGameNodeLibrary;
    * }
    *
    * extern "C" DT_EXAMPLE_EXPORT void DestroyPluginRegistry(dtDirector::NodePluginRegistry* registry)
    * { 
    *   if (registry != NULL)
    *   delete registry;
