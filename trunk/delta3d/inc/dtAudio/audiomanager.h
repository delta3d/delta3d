   /** dtAudio::AudioManager
    *
    * dtAudio::AudioManager is the interface to the underlying audio-
    * engine; OpenAL.
    *
    * Before using, the user must instantiate and configure the
    * AudioManager:
    *
    *    AudioManager::Instantiate();
    *
    * Optionally the user can create an AudioConfigData structure
    * to pass to the AudioManager when configuring set some of the
    * base functionalit of the manager.  Currently only the number
    * of sources is set this way.  It is encouraged, but not required,
    * that the user know how many channels their audio hardware uses
    * and set the number of sources = the number of channels.
    *
    * After user is finished with all sound, the AudioManager should
    * be freed:
    *
    *    AudioManager::Destroy();
    *
    * FOR THE USER:
    * Sounds are not created by the user, but they are requested from
    * the AudioManager.  After getting a sound from the AudioManager
    * the user then calls the sound's functions.  When the user is
    * finished with the sound, the sound should be passed back to
    * the AudioManager for free the resource.
    *
    * There is one global listener which the user also requests from
    * the AudioManager.  After getting the listener from the AudioManager
    * the usere then calls the listener's functions.  When finished
    * with the listener, the user does NOT free it.  The listener is
    * just an interface to AudioManager's protected object and the
    * AudioManager will handle it's resources.
    *
    * In many cases it's more efficeint to preload the sounds into
    * the AudioManager before loading them into the individual sounds.
    *
    * FOR THE DEVELOPER:
    * The AudioManager is a repository for all sounds objects and
    * their corresponding buffer.
    *
    * At pre-frame, the AudioManager process all the sounds waiting for
    * command processing.
    * State commands are commnads to change the state of the sound
    * (play, stop, pause, etc.), but not the value of any of the sounds
    * attributes (gain, pitch, etc.).  Value commands change the value of
    * a sound's attributes.  State commands are pushed onto the Sound's
    * command queue for further processing at the appropriate time (frame change).
    *
    * At frame time, AudioManager process all Sounds with commands in their
    * respective queues.
