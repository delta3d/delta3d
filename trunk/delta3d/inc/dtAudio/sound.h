   /** dtAudio::Sound
    *
    * dtAudio::Sound is a little more than just an interface to an object
    * held within (and protected) by the dtAudio::AudioManager.
    *
    * Sound objects are not usually created directly by the user (new/delete).
    * Instead the user requests a new sound from the AudioManager:
    *
    *    Sound* mysound = AudioManager::GetInstance().NewSound();
    *
    * The user can then call any of the Sound interface functions.
    * After the user is finished with Sound, it should be returned
    * to the AudioManager for recycling:
    *
    *    AudioManager::GetInstance().FreeSound( mysound );
    *
    * Sounds do not usually directly call the underlying sound-engine functions,
    * but rather send commands to their command queue.  The AudioManager will
    * run through all Sounds that have been initialized by it and process
    * their queues at frame time.
    *
    * Since the Sound commands (play, stop, pitch, etc.) may not happen
    * immediately, Sound has two callback functions which, if set by
    * the user, will get fired off when the Sound actually starts
    * playing and when it actually stops playing.
    *
    * Sound is a transformable, so it can be a child of other
    * transformables.  When a Sound is child of another object, it
    * automatically gets positioned in scene-space relative to the
    * parent object every frame, so there is no need to update the
    * Sound's position.  The Sound position can be set manually in
    * scene-space without having to make it a child of another object,
    * but any position updates must then be made manually.
    *
    *********************       WARNING       ********************
    * The serialization member functions have not been tested.  They
    * may work well.  Also, the functions require for playback,
    * CreateFrameData and UseFrameData have not been tested.  They
    * may be working.  An application was not developed to explicitly
    * test these functions due to lack of time.
