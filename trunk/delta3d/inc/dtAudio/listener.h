    *
    * dtAudio::Listener is just an interface to the global listener
    * object held within (and protected) by the dtAudio::AudioManager.
    *
    * The listener is not created directly by the user (new/delete).
    * Instead the user requests the listener from the AudioManager:
    *
    *    Listener* global_ear = AudioManager::GetInstance().GetListener();
    *
    * The user can then call any of the Listener interface functions.
    * After the user is finished with the Listener, there is no need to
    * free it up.  The underlying listener object is a global singular
    * which lasts as long as the AudioManager exists.
    *
    * Listener is a transformable, so it can be a child of other
    * transformables (ie. the camera)  When a Listener is child of
    * another object, it automatically gets positioned in scene-space
    * relative to the parent object every frame, so there is no need to
    * update the Listener's position.  The Listener position can be set
    * manually in scene-space without having to make it a child of another
    * object, but any position updates must then be made manually.
