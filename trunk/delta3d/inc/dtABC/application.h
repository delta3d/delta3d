   /** The Application class of the dtCore Application Base Class library
     * is the base level class for most applications.  It contains the basic
     * components required for applications.
     * An optional XML configuration file can be supplied on the constructor which
     * contains the attributes for the internal DeltaWin, Camera, and Scene.  
     * A default Config File can be created by calling GenerateDefaultConfigFile().
     * This file will contain the default parameters and can be edited, then 
     * supplied to the constructor.
     *
     * Typical use:
     * \code
     * Application *app = new Application("Mydatafile.xml");
     * app->Config();
     * app->Run();
     * \endcode
