    *   actor types will have the same name and category.
    * @note
    *   Categories of an actor type are represented in a hierarchial dot

    *   ActorType objects have a notion of a type hierarchy.  Therefore, when
    *   creating a new actor type, its parent type must be specified.  This allows
    *   queries to be made against the actor type to dermine if it is an "instance"
    *   of another type.
