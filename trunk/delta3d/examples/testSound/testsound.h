/// TestSoundApp class, the main application class

/** The Application class for this test.  It handles the basic requirments
* for a dtABC::Application.
* 
* In the constructor, this class will create and configure the
* dtAudio::AudioManager, pre-load some sound files (optional), and
* get a single sound object for use through out the durration of this app.
*
* The destructor, frees the single sound object and shuts down the
* dtAudio::AudioManager.
* 
* The KeyPress function demonstrates two ways to play sounds.  Any key other
* than the space-bar will play the one sound that this app is holding on to.
* If that one sound is currently playing, extra calls to it's play function
* will have no effect.  Pressing the space bar will create as many transient
* sound objects as needed and play them.  This app intentionally does not
* save pointers to those transient sound objects.
*
* The SoundStartedCB is just a window dressing callback to alert the user
* that a sound started playing.
*
* The SoundStoppedCB also alerts the user that a sound stopped, but is more
* important, in this case, because it also frees all the transient sounds
* that were not saved by this app when they were created.
*
* Both methods of sound managment are appropriate depending on the user's
* needs.  If a small number of sounds are needed, holding pointers to them
* for the durration of the application may be the better choice.  However,
* if large numbers of sound must be played, using the transient sound
* method is more efficient, since the dtAudio::AudioManager will recycle
* sound objects after they have been freed.
