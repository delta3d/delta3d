# - Locate OpenAL
# This module defines
#  OPENAL_LIBRARY
#  OPENAL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenAL 
#  OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers
#   
# $OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR
# used in building OpenAL.
#   
# Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake module.
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# OPENAL_LIBRARY to override this selection.
# Tiger will include OpenAL as part of the System.
# But for now, we have to look around.
# Other (Unix) systems should be able to utilize the non-framework paths.
