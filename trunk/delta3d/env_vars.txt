Delta3D makes use of Environment Variables to find files when compiling, linking, and at runtime.

These environment variables should be set prior to using Delta3D:

DELTA_ROOT = c:\program files\delta3d  (or wherever Delta3D is installed)
DELTA_INC  = %DELTA_ROOT%\inc;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\inc
DELTA_LIB  = %DELTA_ROOT%\lib;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\lib
DELTA_DATA = %DELTA_ROOT%\data
PATH       = %DELTA_ROOT%\bin;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\bin


--Win32--
To set Environment variables on Window platforms, open My Computer->Propterties->Advanced->Environment Variables.  You can enter the variables system-wide (using the system variables) or User-only (using the User Variabels).

Once set, these variables can be used in Visual Studio in the project properties or in the global VC++ directories (Tools->Options->Projects) as shown below:
Include files : $(DELTA_INC) 
Library files : $(DELTA_LIB)
