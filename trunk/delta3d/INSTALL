# Delta3D Source Installation #
#                             #
###############################

Win32 w/ Visual Studio .NET 7.1
-------------------------------

1. Download the following packages from Sourceforge:

   delta3d-dependencies
   delta3d-data

   Extract them in your delta3d directory.

2. Open src/delta.sln, build!

3. Examples can be built view the examples/examples.sln
   file.

4. Utilities each have their own solution. Open to build.

Note:
HLA-related modules/examples/utilities require RTI, which
we cannot distribute. To build the module dtHLA, example
testHLA, and utility hlaStealthViewer, RTI must be installed
with the RTI_HOME, RTI_BUILD_TYPE, and RTI_RID_FILE envionment
variables set. VS solutions are provided for these apps as:

src/dthla.sln
examples/testHLA/testHLA.sln
utilities/hlaStealthViewer

dtPython requires the following additional downloads:
-python 2.3.4
-boost 1.31.0


Linux 
-----
Tested on:
Fedora Core-up (2.6.5-1.358)

1. Run 'glxinfo | grep direct'.
   If you get 'direct rendering: yes' skip to 3.
   Else...

2. Install OpenGL drivers for your video card.

   For info on how to do this, see:

   ATI:   http://www.fedorafaq.org/#radeon
   Nvdia: http://www.fedorafaq.org/#nvidia

3. Download the following packages from Sourceforge:

   delta3d-dependencies
   delta3d-data

   Extract them in your delta3d directory.

4. Download CMake from http://www.cmake.org .
   We use CMake to synconize cross-platform builds of Delta3D.


5. You will notice files called CMakeLists.txt in the following directories:

   src/
   examples/
   utilities/bspCompiler
   utilities/psEditor
   utilities/Viewer

   These files are high-level instructions that tell CMake how to genereate 
   Makefiles for your configuration. In each of these directories run:

   'cmake .', and then 'make' 

   to build the apprpropriate files. 	

   To build the Delta3D source, also run 'make install' to place the shared
   libraries in the ../lib folder.

   Uncomment SUBDIRS( python ) to build dtPython as well. Make sure to
   run the script install_linux_python from src/python to create 
   necessary symbolic links to Python modules. Also don't forgot to
   point your PYTHONPATH environment variable to directory containing
   these links.

Note:
HLA requires RTI, as mentioned above. Instructions to build HLA-related
apps are as follows:

dtHLA   : Uncomment the relavent portion of src/CMakeLists.txt .

testHLA : Run 'cmake .' from examples/testHLA/ and then 'make' .

hlaStealthViewer : Run 'cmake .' from utilities/hlaStealthViewer/ 
                   and then 'make'
