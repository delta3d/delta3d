##############################

---------
| 1.1.0 |
---------

New Features
------------
-The GameManager. The new dtGame namespace can be used to easily communicate
 between actors in your game. It also provides an entry point for After-Action
 Review and rules enforcement.

-dtCore::Camera can now be enabled or disabled.

-Map loading through dtABC::BaseABC::LoadMap will automciatlly hook your map up 
 with the default Scene and also set the default DeltaWin to any Cameras in the
 map.

-Bezier curves can now be created and edited directly in STAGE.

-dtCore::System now has pause functionality.

-Added support for Triggers and Actions, with associated Actor Proxies in 
 dtActors.

-Tripod Actor Proxy support in dtActors.

-dtGUI::CEUIDrawable can now have children DeltaDrawables. This places the 
 children in the same coorindate system as the 2D GUI.

-dtDAL/tree.h moved to dtUtil/tree.h.

-Added ability to set collision bits and collision groups. This allows selective
 collisions between classes or instances. Especially useful for ProximityTrigger.

-dtABC::StateManager::EventType is now public. This means one can listen for 
 state transition events.

-Added TerraPage support to the Viewer.

-testTerrain now uses models from the Delta3D Asset Library for vegetation 
 placement.

-New dependency package including InterSense SDK recompiled for MSVS 2003 & PLIB
 headers moved to a subdirectory.

-New data package 1.1.0. Includes new data for testTerrain.

Bug Fixes
---------
-Client geometry is now removed from Scene when the client disconnects.

-Fixed an occassional crash in testNetwork when a client connects.

-All DeltaDrawables now contain normal pointers to their parent Scene instead of
 RefPtrs. The allows the Scene to be properly destroyed without circular 
 references.

-Fixed flickering when two Cameras overlapped on one Window.

-Fixed incorrectly shaded SOARX terrain in dtTerrain.

-Fixed geometry seems in dtTerrain.

-Setting data file path list to contain $DELTA_DATA/gui will allow proper
 loading of all CEGUI elements.

-Updated all MSVS solultions to have correct dependencies.

-Fixed nearly all warnings on MSVC.

-Python bindings for Map::FindProxies now works. 
 Check out examples/testMap/testmap.py!

---------
| 1.0.0 |
---------

-Matrix Utilities are now confirmed to be "row major".
-Closing the DeltaWin now exits the applications by default.
-The Recorder class has been completely rewritten so that any class can be
 recorded, without the need for multiple inheritance.
-testRecorder example has been added.
-Fixed Statistics bug that caused Linux applications to crash.
-Noise classes have been added to dtUtil.
-Changed StateManager's XML schema to require an Event tag to have the 'Type' 
 attribute.
-testNetwork now supports multiple players.
-dtDAL string utilities are now located in dtUtil.
-Moved Xerces utilities into dtUtil/xercesutils.h.
-dtDAL::Exception has been moved to dtUtil.

-Added testBumpMap example.
-Added testShaders example.
-Terrain rendering has been rearchitected and implemented as "dtTerrain".
-SOARX terrain has been merged into dtTerrain.
-GENETICS has been merged into dtTerrain.
-Added additional Python examples (testSound.py, testMap.py)

Bug Fixes:
-Fixed crash on exit after using a shader.

-Crash on exit from adding shaders to a Scene is fixed by using the latest NVidia drivers.
-Window Installer now doesn't change system fonts when un-installed.
-Fixed a bug that cound cause the StateManager to become invalid after parsing a file.
-Fixed bug that caused the motion models not to work in the Viewer.
