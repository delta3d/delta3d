TestClient example

 ------------
| How to use |
 ------------
To use example launch first testEchoServer and then testClient. At startup the app connect to echo server and send/receive messages to/from it.

To test the problem it is needed to click 'D' key on Client window to disconnect the client from the server. Then if you type 'C' key on the client window it will try to reconnect to the server but it seems that something doesn't work correctly.
