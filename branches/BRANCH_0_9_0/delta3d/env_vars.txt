Delta3D makes use of Environment Variables to find files at runtime. These 
variables are NOT necessary to build within a particular source tree as we use 
relative pathing. However, most Delta3D applications use these to reference 
the libraries and data.

Win32
-----
Make sure the Delta3D environment variables are set by either the Win32 
installer or env_var_setup.exe in delta3d/utilities. The following 
variables are set:

DELTA_ROOT = c:\program files\delta3d  (or wherever Delta3D is installed)
DELTA_INC  = %DELTA_ROOT%\inc;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\inc
DELTA_LIB  = %DELTA_ROOT%\lib;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\lib
DELTA_DATA = %DELTA_ROOT%\data

And of course add  %DELTA_ROOT%\bin;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\bin to your PATH.

Alternatively you can set them manually by opening:
   My Computer->Propterties->Advanced->Environment Variables.  
You can enter the variables system-wide (using the system variables) or User-only 
(using the User Variables).

Once set, these variables can be used in Visual Studio in the project properties
 or in the global VC++ directories (Tools->Options->Projects) as shown below:

Include files : $(DELTA_INC) 
Library files : $(DELTA_LIB)

Linux
-----
DELTA_ROOT: path to your Delta3D installation
DELTA_DATA: $DELTA_ROOT/data
DELTA_INC:  $DELTA_ROOT/inc:$DELTA_ROOT/ext/inc
DELTA_LIB:  $DELTA_ROOT/lib:$DELTA_ROOT/ext/lib

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DELTA_LIB

Don't forget to 'export' your variables if you are using Bash!
