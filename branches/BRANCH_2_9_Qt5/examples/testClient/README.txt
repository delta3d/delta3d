TestClient example

 ------------
| How to use |
 ------------
To use example launch first testEchoServer and then testClient. At startup the app connect to echo server 
and send/receive messages to/from it.

Press the 'D' key with focus on the Client window to disconnect the client from the server. Then if you type 'C' key
in the client window it will try to reconnect to the server.  You should see
the echo message logging stop and start again with a disconnect and
reconnect..
