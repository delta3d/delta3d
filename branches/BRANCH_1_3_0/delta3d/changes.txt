| 1.3.0 |
---------

New Features
------------

-The SoarXDrawable renderer in dtTerrain now auto-calculates it's memory buffer size.

-Started new Doxygen-generated example tutorials (testApp, testGUI).

-KeyboardListener and MouseListener classes will derive from a reference counted base class.

-Callbacks added via dtGUI::ScriptModule::AddCallback must now return bool, conforming to the signature defined by dtGUI::ScriptModule::HandlerFunctor (breaking change).

-Default Mouse and Keyboards class now use the chain of responsibility pattern for input handling.

-Keyboard's specialKeyPress and specialKeyRelease are now merged into keyPress and keyRelease (breaking change).

-All code referencing dtCore::MouseButton will now need to reference dtCore::Mouse::MouseButton (breaking change).

-To support the chain of responsibility pattern, ButtonListener::ButtonStateChanged changed its signature to: bool ButtonStateChanged(const Button* button, bool oldState, bool newState);
and AxisListener::AxisStateChanged changed its signature to: bool AxisStateChanged(const Axis* axis, double oldState, double newState, double delta) (breaking change).

-Set the dtCore::Scene's default gravity to -9.81 in the Z axis

-dtCore::Light now derives from dtCore::Transformable instead of dtCore::DeltaDrawable.

-DeltaDrawable::GetOSGNode is now a pure virtual interface function. Subclasses are responsible for storing their own osg::Node's and returning them via GetOSGNode.

-KeyboardListener and MouseListener are now reference counted (breaking change).

-KeyboardListener and MouseListener are abstract classes now (breaking change).

-dtABC::Application lost several member functions when its inheritance was changed with respect to keyboard and mouse callbacks.  It now supports one, for ease of use, which is dtABC::Application::KeyPressed.

-DeltaWin now throws exceptions if invalid input parameters are passed to its constructor.

-New unit tests for dtGUI.

-The member functions of Keyboard and Mouse listener classes now return a bool and receive a const Keyboard pointer or const Mouse pointer, respectively (breaking change).

- Mouse::ButtonPress changed to Mouse::ButtonDown. Mouse::ButtonRelease changed to Mouse::ButtonUp.
Both functions now take a MouseButton enum rather than an integer (breaking change).

-dtInspector now supports all three types of Lights.

-dtCore::Timer has bee modified to provide a high-level wrapper around osg::Timer (breaking change).

-dtGUI::ScriptModule now supports non-static callbacks.

-Squelched a warning from the Xerces parser if the user doesn't use a schema file.

-There are now Python bindings for dtUtil::Enumeration, dtDAL::DataType, and dtDAL::ActorProperty.

-Mouse and Keyboards can now be created in user code.

-dtCore::EnvEffet is now an abstract class. Repaint is pure virtual (breaking change).

-dtCore::EffectListener is now an abstract class (EffectAdded and EffectRemoved are pure virtual). The class is now also referenced counted (breaking changes).

-The unit tests now build by default when using the SCons build system.

-Viewer now can load and display Map files.

-EffectManager has been refactored to allow extensible DetonationTypes by string. Small breaking change: the deprecated function "DetonationType Detonation::GetType() const" is now "void Detonation::GetType(DetonationType& type) const" is order to let the GetType with no arguments return the string DetonationType.

-Added basic Python bindings for dtTerrain::Terrain and dtTerrain::GeoCoordinates.

-Added ability to change the dtUtil::Log filename (contribued by Isdale).

-Added dtUtil/version.h which allows users to test for the working version of Delta3D at compile time or at runtime.

-Mouse's members functions buttonPress and buttonRelease have been renamed ButtonDown and ButtonUp to be consistent with our style guide and not conflict with #defines in X11 headers. Similarly, Keyboard's keyPress and keyRelease have been changed to KeyDown and KeyUp.

-dtTerrain now has API added to control if the terrain should be rendered with fog on/off.

-Added basic line of sight calculation in dtTerrain (courtesy of Jerry Isdale).

-testRecorder's "initialize" function is deprecated in favor of "Initialize" per our style guide.

-Public data members in dtCore::SunlightShader & dtCore::SkydomeShader are now private with accessors (breaking change).

-New build script options for Linux:
  bindir=install directory for exectuables (overrides prefix)
  includedir=install directory for headers (overrides prefix)
  libdir=install directory for libraries (overrides prefix)

-New data package 1.3.0

Bug Fixes
---------

-InfiniteTerrain now supports collisions with cylinders.

-Globals actors can now be deleted from STAGE via the global actor menu using the toolbar 'X' button.

-CEGUI stuff can be properly shutdown now by calling CEUIDrawable::ShutdownGUI.

-Fixed bug in dtTerrain that results in an invisible terrain if fog is turned off.

-Fixed bug that caused the dtABC::Application not to use the ChangeDisplayResolution attribute in the config.xml file.

-Fixed bug in InfiniteLight which would result returning the wrong Azimuth and Elevation values.

-Fixed bug that would case a dtABC::State not to have it's ShutDown() method called.

-An exception in DeltaWin's constructor no longer can cause bad memory to live in the MANAGEMENT_LAYER vector.

-Changing display resolution in fullscreen mode works both ways now.

-InfiniteLight::GetAzimuthElevation is now returning correct values.

-Cleaned up FPSMotionModel.  Integrated changes from the user "gcw".

-Transformables now correctly collide with InfiniteTerrain.

| 1.1.0 |
---------

New Features
------------
-The GameManager. The new dtGame namespace can be used to easily communicate
 between actors in your game. It also provides an entry point for After-Action
 Review and rules enforcement.

-dtTerrain has been refactored. The whole entire reader,
 renderer, terrain, and tile architecture is new since 1.0.0.

-dtCore::Camera can now be enabled or disabled.

 children in the same coorindate system as the 2D GUI.

 collisions between classes or instances. Especially useful for ProximityTrigger.

 state transition events.
