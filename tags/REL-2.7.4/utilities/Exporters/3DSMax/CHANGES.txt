OSGExp Goes Delta3D- (2-Feb-2007)
-added support for DOFNodes
-added support for selecting which switch nodes are active by default
-fixed support for mixing vertex colors with a diffuse texture
-fixed linking issues which disabled support for max linking
-updated to compile against OSG 1.2

OSGExp 0.9.3pre4 (4-Apr-2006)
- Static Linked version
- Made changes so that it compiles with the HEAD revision of OpenSceneGraph

OSGExp 0.9.3pre3 (20-Feb-2006)
- Added (untested) support for Architectural materials.

OSGExp 0.9.3pre2 (23-Jan-2006)
- Added installation support for Max 8
- Bug fix: Fixed exporting of the StateSet Helper. Exporting settings like 
  polygon offset now works correctly. Problem was that stateset where shared.


OSGExp 0.9.3pre1 (26-Okt-2005)
- Bug fix: Fixed a bug in the normal generation for billboards.
- Bug fix: Now the reader writer options are reset. So when you turn 'include
  images' in ive on again, it will work.
- Bug fix: In stead of setting self illumination to white, the diffuse color is
  copied to the emissive color. This way also none diffuse baked textures will
  work.
- Bug fix: It doesn't crash anymore on exporting multi-materials and the
  Self-Illumination is handeled right.
- Bug fix: Fixed a texture repeating bug. Negative texture coordinates would not
  result in texture repeating unless values became smaller then -1.
- Bug fix: Fixed a bug that messed up the texture coordinates. Also changed the
  vertex color generation in the same way.
- Bug fix: Fixed filename output in errormessage.
- Created a new installer for Max6 and Max7 using NSIS
  (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/).
- Added Use Alpha Blending option to the OSG StateSet helper object.
- Added support for PolygonOffset.
- Added support for PolygonMode.
- Added support for Point helpers.
- Added support for Dummy helpers. A dummy helper will be exported as an empty
  group.
- Added Self Illumination map export. Can be used for applying light maps (multi
  texture) using Render to Texture from Max.
- Automaticly turn two sided lighting on for two sided materials.
- When saving as ive and a texture compression is selected, the images will be
  saved compressed in the ive file. Behaviour taken from osgconv.
- Made the following features optional (using the export dialog):
  * The exporting of opacity maps
  * The exporting of unknown maps
  * The automaticy setting the alpha blending for materials where the texture 
    map has an alpha channel.
  * The automaticly turing on two sided lighting if the material is two sided.
  * The exporting of the self illumination map
  * The exporting of point helpers
- Modified stateset helper to a super stateset helper. Idea based on the OSGExp
  of Emmanuel Roche. It modifies the stateset helper by adding a number of
  rollups:
  * GLMode rollup
  * RenderBin rollup
  * PolygonOffset rollup
  * PolygonMode rollup
- Improved animation support from Emmanuel Roche including dummy animation and
  group animation.
- When using the setDiffuseToWhite color not only the diffuse component is set
  to white, but also the ambient component is converted to gray.
- Only set the emissive color when it is turned on. Otherwize set it to black.
- Modified the project files so that Hybrid is now called Debug and that the
  debug version now outputs OSGExpd and OSGHelperd files.
- Modified the project files so that when the project is put in the same
  directory as OpenScenegraph, Producer and OpenThreads, the include files and
  library files are automaticly located. So no need to put these in the global
  VisualStudio settings. The only paths that need to be put in the visual studio
  include and lib paths are those for the maxsdk.


OSGExp 0.9.2b (5-Dec-2003)
- Support for the new osgUtil::Optimizer including Tri Strip Geometry, Merge
  Geometry, Flatten Static Transforms, Share Duplicate State, and Spatialize
  Groups.
- Every node is optimized to use STATIC datavariance instead of OSG's default
  DYNAMIC.
- Small bug fixes.


OSGExp 0.9.2a (22-Nov-2003)
- Support for PagedLOD - just check the PagedLOD box in the LOD helper object
  and OSGExp does the rest ;-)
- Better support for Opacity maps, it is now possible to specify the blend
  amount.
- Better support for standard and default NodeMasks, introducing Terrain,
  Collision, No Collision and Custom NodeMasks.
- OSGExp now comes with a simpel preview function directly from within 3ds max.


OSGExp 0.9.2 (6-Okt-2003)
- OSGExp version 0.9.2 is released as Open Source

OSGExp (Summer 2003)
- OSGExp goes beta - thanks to all the beta testers!


OSGExp (Spring 2003)
- OSGExp is used for real time architechtual visualization of the new head
  quarter of the Danish Broadcast Cooperation in Örestaden.
