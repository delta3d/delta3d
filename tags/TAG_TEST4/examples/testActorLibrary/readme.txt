Uses modules: dtActors, dtCore, dtDAL, dtUtil

Purpose
-------

The testActorLibrary project will generate a library containing some 
actors.  The actors, while not terribly useful, can be loaded into
STAGE or any other GameManager-based application.

The testActorLibrary is not used by itself and mostly lives to
support the UnitTests and as a coding example.
