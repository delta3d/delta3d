    *  To use this class, create an instance and call InitializeGame(); this will
    *  setup the internals of the network.  Then call either SetupServer() or
    *  SetupClient() to start the networking.  To end the networking, just call
    *  the Shutdown() method.
    *
    *  To pass data packets through the network, supply a GNE::Packet to SendPacketToAll().
    *  A custom GNE::Packet must be registered with GNE after InitilizeGame() using:
    *  \code   GNE::PacketParser::defaultRegisterPacket<MyCustomPacket>(); \endcode
