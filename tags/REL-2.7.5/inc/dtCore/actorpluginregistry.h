    * The ActorPluginRegistry is the base class that developers extend to
    * build their own Actor registries.  Its main purpose is to serve as an
    * object factory which knows how to build ActorProxies using
    * ActorTypes as the tool by which to do so.
    * @note
    *      Registry objects should only be used with the dtCore::RefPtr<>
    *      construct since they are reference counted objects.
    * @see ActorType
    * @see BaseActorObject
    * @note The dynamic library file containing the Actor Registry must contain
    *  two exported "C" methods, to create and destroy the ActorPluginRegistry.
    *
    * Example:
    * @code
    * extern "C" DT_EXAMPLE_EXPORT dtCore::ActorPluginRegistry* CreatePluginRegistry()
    * {
    *    return new TestGameActorLibrary;
    * }
    *
    * extern "C" DT_EXAMPLE_EXPORT void DestroyPluginRegistry(dtCore::ActorPluginRegistry* registry)
    * { 
    *   if (registry != NULL)
    *   delete registry;
    * }
