These folders contain CMake scripts which build only the projects for the
Delta3D Examples.

These scripts use the Finddt*.cmake files to build applications external to
the Delta3D engine and show a good example how to build your own Delta3D
application using CMake.

Note: This is a wholly separate, standalone build from the
%DELTA_ROOT%/CMakeLists.txt file and assumes that the Delta3D engine has
already been compiled.
