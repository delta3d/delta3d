/** \page testApp Application Tutorial
*  \dontinclude testApp.cpp
* This tutorial will decompose the testApp example, found in the Delta3D/Examples folder. It
* is meant as a very simple introduction to the dtABC::Application class.  When you run
* testApp.exe, this is what you should see:
* \image html testApp.jpg
* 
* The first thing we need to do is include some header files.  In this example, we'll include
* all the header files which are required for this example.  We could have also included the main
* headers dt.h and dtABC.h, which correspond to namespaces and subsequently, the libraries we need.
* <b>When you include these header files, the library files get automatically linked in</b>.  Since
* we're not using the main header files, we have to setup our project file to link in the additional libraries
* and their dependencies.
* \skip camera.h
* \until application.h
*
* Now we can set up our search paths to find the data files we'll use in the application.  In
* this case, we append a couple of strings together, separated by a semi-colon:
* \skip main
* \until );
*
* Now we can create a new dtABC::Application.  Notice we're storing it as a dtCore::RefPtr.  This
* will allow it to be delete automatrically when the variable goes out of scope.  We're also
* passing in the name of a config file which will allow us to change some aspects of this application.
* \skipline RefPtr

* Then we create a couple of dtCore::Object and give them files to load.  Don't forget to add it to the Scene,
* or else it won't get rendered. To do this, we can just use dtABC::Application::AddDrawable().
* \skipline "Terrain"
* \until brdm.get
*
* On the second dtCore::Object, lets set its position using the dtCore::Transform
* class.  In this case, the Transform just changes the heading  by 90 degrees.
* \until SetTransform
*
* Now we can set up the dtCore::Camera position by giving it a position and a place to look at.
* \until app->GetCamera()
* 
* And finally, tell the dtABC::Application to configure and to run.  The dtABC::Application::Run() method
* is blocking, meaning it won't return control back until the the Application has exited.  To quit the 
* app, just hit the escape key.
* \until return
