Delta3D makes use of Environment Variables to find files at runtime.

These environment variables should be set prior to using Delta3D:

DELTA_ROOT = c:\program files\delta3d  (or wherever Delta3D is installed)
DELTA_INC  = %DELTA_ROOT%\inc;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\inc
DELTA_LIB  = %DELTA_ROOT%\lib;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\lib
DELTA_DATA = %DELTA_ROOT%\data
PATH       = %DELTA_ROOT%\bin;%DELTA_ROOT%\ext\bin


--Win32--
To set Environment variables on Window platforms, open My Computer->Propterties->Advanced->Environment Variables.  You can enter the variables system-wide (using the system variables) or User-only (using the User Variables).

You can also set the Environment Variables using the supplied Environment Variable Installer located in the Delta3d\utilities folder.

Once set, these variables can be used in Visual Studio in the project properties or in the global VC++ directories (Tools->Options->Projects) as shown below:
Include files : $(DELTA_INC) 
Library files : $(DELTA_LIB)
