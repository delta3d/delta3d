    * <p>
    * The Thread Pool exists to create worker threads to allow more efficient and easy to use threading of programming
    * tasks.  The basic use case is to initialize this with the default settings so that it will create one thread
    * for each CPU core minus 1 because 1 main execution thread already exists.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * Then for large tasks, specifically ones with lots of data, you create tasks. You generally want break up the work
    * load into enough tasks so that you will have work for every CPU core to do.  If you break it up into enough tasks,
    * then as machines get more and more cores, the application will automatically scale up.
    * Once the tasks have been added, then call ExecuteTasks() on the calling thread so that it, too, will work on
    * the tasks so as to give the maximum performance.
    * </p>
    *
    * E.g. <br>
    * for (...) <br>
    *    ThreadPool::AddTask(*new CustomTask(dataBlocks[i])); <br>
    * <br>
    * ThreadPool::ExecuteTasks(); <br>
    * <br>
    *
    * <p>
    * Sometimes it makes sense to just run something in the background while other things run on the main cpu, such
    * I.O. intensive tasks that will block.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * In this case, just call
    * </p>
    * <p>
    *  ThreadPool::AddTask(*new CustomTask(), ThreadPool::BACKGROUND);
    * </p>
    *
    * <p>
    * Background tasks will run whenever threads have no IMMEDIATE tasks to complete.  Also, if you init the thread
    * pool on a single core box or request 0 threads, then there will still be a  thread just for doing background tasks
    * so that things like IO specific tasks will still run in the background and not block the main thread.
